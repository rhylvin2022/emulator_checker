# 📱 Emulator Checker

A **Flutter plugin** that detects whether an app is running on an **emulator** or a **real device**. This can be useful for **security measures**, **analytics**, and **feature flagging**, allowing developers to modify app behavior based on the runtime environment.

## 🛠 Installation

Add this to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  emulator_checker: latest_version
```

Run:
```sh
flutter pub get
```

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Null safety** support (starting from version 3.0.0)  
✅ Detects if the app is running on an **emulator**  
✅ Supports **Android** and **iOS**  
✅ Lightweight and easy to use

## 🚀 Usage

Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:emulator_checker/emulator_checker.dart';
```

### Example: Detect if Running on an Emulator

```dart
void checkDevice() async {
  bool isEmulator = await EmulatorChecker().isEmulator();
  print(isEmulator ? "Running on an emulator" : "Running on a real device");
}
```

## 💡 Why Use Emulator Detection?
- **Security**: Prevent unauthorized access by blocking emulators.
- **Analytics**: Exclude emulator-based test data from analytics reports.
- **Feature Control**: Restrict certain app features for real devices only.
