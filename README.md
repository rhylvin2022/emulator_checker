# 📱 Emulator Checker

A **Flutter plugin** that detects whether an app is running on an **emulator** or a **real device**. This can be useful for **security measures**, **analytics**, and **feature flagging**, allowing developers to modify app behavior based on the runtime environment.

  emulator_checker: latest_version
```

Run:
```sh
flutter pub get
```

## 🚀 Usage

```dart
import 'package:emulator_checker/emulator_checker.dart';

### Example: Detect if Running on an Emulator

```dart
void checkDevice() async {
  bool isEmulator = await EmulatorChecker().isEmulator();
  print(isEmulator ? "Running on an emulator" : "Running on a real device");
}
```

## 📌 Features
✅ Detects if the app is running on an **emulator**
